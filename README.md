# AI Productathon!
### Theme:
> “Build AI Products that Solve Real Problems”

---

## Goals:
- Prepare team for future projects where we have to build projects with AI Integration
- Understand the new possibilities that AI brings us
- Allow members to build and showcase new projects and make their own tech choices
- Incentivize research and personal growth
- Teambuilding & bonding

## Tracks:
- **Impact to Organization**
- **Productivity** (Personal Productivity or Work productivity)
- **AI for Impact** (Create some positive impact in society any way you can with your product)
- **Devtools**
- **AI for Learning**
- **Open Track**

## Team formation:
- 2 members with a synergizing skillset

## Time period:
- Four weeks, demo starts from Week 2 for people that are ready
- Starts on Friday, April 25th after team finalization

## Judging:
- Showcase & present your product at the end of the time period.
- The winning team gets goodies (tbd) and *bragging rights* 🥳
- Let's not get too swept away with *✨vibe coding✨*, this is a learnathon as much as it is a hackathon

## Criteria:
- Proper utilization of AI
- Real world impact & Practicality
- Technical implementation
- UX & Usability (We are known for our designs!)
- Solution to problem

## Essential topics to look into:
- Interfacing with AI:
> - Rest APIs
> - SDKs like `openai`, Vercel `ai` SDK
> - Running AI models locally through ollama, lmstudio, etc
	
- Prompt Engineering
> - Essential prompt engineering techniques to achieve your goal
> - Essential concepts like X-shot prompting, providing context, providing examples, etc.
> - Setting up guard rails
	
- AI Ecosystem:
> - Popular LLM platforms like ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, grok, etc
> - Ollama, LMStudio Huggingface, etc
> - Popular terminologies like Parameters, Context window, etc
> - Frameworks (optional): langchain, huggingface transformers, etc
	
- UI/UX for AI
> - The most common UI to interface with AI is chat interfaces
> - Other notable ways are through mediums like voice, user action recording, mobile apps, browser extensions, VSCode plugins, embedable chatbots, API-only, etc

## What we *are* doing
- Building amazing products on top of existing solutions
- Learning enough to adapt ourselves to this new turn in the market

## What we are *not* doing
- Being AI Researchers / Scientists. We are engineers, we build stuff. We solve real problems, for real people.
